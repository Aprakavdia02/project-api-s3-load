### Project Documentation: Extracting Data from an Open API and Storing It in AWS S3

#### 1. **Python Environment Setup**

A Python environment is crucial to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between libraries used in different projects. It also ensures control over the exact versions of libraries needed for the project.

For this project, I used `venv`, a standard Python tool that manages Python packages. An alternative to `venv` is `conda`, a package manager that not only handles Python libraries but also manages non-Python dependencies.

#### 2. **Installing Dependencies**

The following dependencies are required for this project:

- **boto3**: The AWS SDK for Python, which allows interaction with AWS services such as S3, EC2, and DynamoDB.
- **requests**: A simple HTTP library to send HTTP requests to APIs and retrieve data, typically used for web scraping and API calls.
- **awscli**: The AWS Command Line Interface, a tool to interact with AWS services from the terminal, allowing easy management of AWS resources.

Both `boto3` and `awscli` were installed to ensure seamless interaction with AWS services. While `boto3` provides programmatic access to AWS through Python, `awscli` offers quick command-line access, which can be useful for manual or automated tasks.

#### 3. **Verifying AWS Account Connection**

To verify the successful installation of dependencies and connection to AWS, a simple check is performed using `boto3`. The following code checks the connection and lists the available S3 buckets (if permission is granted). It also checks the current IAM user associated with the AWS account.

If successful, the output will display the list of S3 buckets and the current IAM user.

#### 4. **Creating an S3 Bucket**

To create a new S3 bucket, we used `boto3`. The following code creates an S3 bucket with a `private` access control list (ACL).

The response includes metadata such as:
- **RequestId**: A unique identifier for the request.
- **HostId**: The host ID associated with the request.
- **HTTPStatusCode**: The status code returned by the API.
- **Location**: The location of the newly created S3 bucket.
- **RetryAttempts**: The number of retry attempts made for the request.

#### 5. **Loading Data into S3 Bucket**

Once the S3 bucket is created, the next step is to load data into it. The data is fetched from an open API (e.g., CoinGecko), cleansed and formatted into JSON, and then uploaded to the S3 bucket.

The API response is checked for a successful status code (200). If successful, the response is converted into a pretty-printed JSON format and uploaded to the S3 bucket using `boto3`. 

This process involves:
- Fetching cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
- Formatting the data into a readable JSON format.
- Uploading the data to the specified S3 bucket (`project-api-s3-load`).
- Printing a success message once the data is successfully uploaded.

#### 6. **Conclusion**

This project involved extracting cryptocurrency data from an open API, using Python, and then uploading it to AWS S3 using `boto3`. By setting up the Python environment, installing necessary dependencies, and verifying AWS access, the project successfully loads external data into an S3 bucket for further processing or analysis.
